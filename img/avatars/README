Tiki Avatars
============

Avatars are 45x45 pictures used to personalize users.
The tiki avatars have been removed from the default installation
for licence reasons.

Some can now downloaded from http://mods.tikiwiki.org

Any picture you copy in this folder will appear in the list of available 
avatars without extra effort.
