The Galaxia Workflow Engine is pre-configured to work with Tikiwiki.

If you're working in a different environment, please rename config.php
to config.tikiwiki.php and replace it with your own config.ABC.php file.

If no specific configuration file exists for your environment yet, have
a look at the others, create your own and then submit it to the Tikiwiki
team for inclusion in CVS - thanks :-)

Site administrators are encouraged to have a look at the configuration
settings if they want to change the location of directories, database
table names etc.
