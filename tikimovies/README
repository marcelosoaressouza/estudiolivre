Add a swf movie in tikimovies/ directory, name it like you want it to be displayed on the select menu, eg. My_movie.swf
Copy sample.xml tp My_movie.xml (the same name as the swf name) and edit that file, at least change the MovieURL to tikimovies/My_movie.swf
Point your browser to /tiki-listmovies.php, it read the dir so you don't need any more declaration.
