* [NEW] apply if something new was added in tikiwiki
* [MOD] is an enhancement; not really new but makes things work better
* [FIX] can be used for bug fixes of any sort
* [SEC] for security fix operations
* [REL] changes for release process only
* [KIL] removal of unused or obsolete files
* -[DB] for changes in the database

	  [MOD] Helkp links: Make visually clear what is a link to another
	  admin panel vs a link to doc.tikiwiki.org	Context: Since
	  1.9.7, some admin panels have been added (category, modules,
	  themes, and text area) and some admin menu settings have been
	  moved to these new admin panels. However, to ease the transition
	  for experienced Tiki admins, a link was left at the old location.
	  However, as a result, there was a visual confusion between these
	  2 link types.

	  __Password invalid after days__ has been always on by default and
	  at 999 days. While this seems like a long time, many sites are
	  reaching that age and users are being asked to change their
	  password. This process is not vert good at the moment. So, I'm
	  going to assume that the vast majority of people left the default
	  but don't want this feature. So the upgrade script will change to
	  1999 days. And clean installs will be at 1999 days as well.  In
	  1.10, the default will be that this feature is turned off (-1)

	  [MOD] Change some forum defaults for new installs.

	  Why? Most people will not change the defaults. These new defaults
	  are chosen to be cleaner and more universal. Of course, Tiki
	  admins can always change to whatever suits them best. See
	  http://tikiwiki.org/DefaultSettingsChanges for details and to
	  comment.

	  1- Accept wiki syntax (feature_forum_parse) is now activated.
	  This is a nice thing of having a wiki + a forum all-in-one.

	  2- Forum listing configuration -> List number of posts per day
	  (forum_list_ppd) and lists number of Topics (forum_list_topics)
	  are now turned off.

	  3- When creating new forums: Default ordering (topicOrdering) for
	  topics: Date (desc) -> Last post (desc)

	  4- When creating new forums: Default ordering (threadOrdering)
	  for threads is now by ascending Date (commentDate_asc) like
	  phpBB.

	  5- When creating new forums: Points (rating posts) are now turned
	  off by default ->  Topic list configuration points
	  (topics_list_pts) & Posts can be rated (vote_threads)

   PHP, we copied those features and integrated the forums with the Tiki
   permission system, rankings, modules and search engine. There's a lot about
   forums so I guess it's best to stop the description here, the documentation
   will introduce all the features in forums.

   this will prevent automatic thumbnail generation. Some users wanted this
   feature because thumbnail generation didn't work or they wanted to upload

   as the full image so you can use this feature. Thumbnails will be displayed
   using the size assignated for thumbnails to the image gallery.
