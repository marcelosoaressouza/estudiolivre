INSTALLATION
------------
The rest of this document includes parts of the online documentation that
might be enough to get you running TikiWiki. For more details, please see:
 http://doc.tikiwiki.org/Installation


Before you get started it is a good idea to know:

    * Your database name, database user name and password
    * Your Apache user and group ID (e.g. www-user and www-data)


If you are using the RPM that is available you can skip down to browser-based
installation.

These are notes on how to setup and configure TikiWiki.


----------------------------
Step one: unpack the archive
----------------------------
Unpack the TikiWiki files to the document root of where you want it installed,
e.g. /var/www/tiki/ 

To unpack the bz2 file, use:
tar xjf tikiwiki-[version].tar.bz2



-----------------------------------------
Step two: run setup.sh to set permissions
-----------------------------------------
CHMOD the file setup.sh to 755.

# chmod 755 setup.sh


Run .setup and follow the instructions

# ./setup.sh



--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step three: run htaccess.sh to make tiki more secure (OPTIONAL STEP)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: you only should do this if the settings of your servers allow the usage
of .htaccess files. But you can try it out, if it doesn't work for you, you
can revert the changes with one step.

CHMOD the file htaccess.sh to 755. "chmod 755 htaccess.sh"

Usage ./htaccess.sh [off]

If you call the script without parameters, it renames all the files named
_htaccess to .htaccess, making them functional. If you get problems with
active .htaccess files, just call the script with the parameter off to rename
the .htaccess files back to _htaccess. That's it!



------------------------------
Step four: browser-based setup
------------------------------
* create a database for TikiWiki
  - often using PhpMyAdmin and MySQL
  - or on the command line "mysqladmin create dbname"
    the database name is usually called "tikiwiki" 
* Point your browser to the web address that corresponds to the file
  tiki-install.php (e.g. http://localhost/tiki/tiki-install.php)
* Follow the instructions there
  you'll need the password and user name for your database 
* use a profile to populate your database.
  default values are very minimal, and basicEnabled maybe suits more
  immediate use
* To log into TikiWiki for the first time:
  - user: admin
  - password: admin


------------------------------
Step five: configure your site
------------------------------
Next you can configure TikiWiki to your suit needs:

* Choose which features you want enabled
  - go to tiki-admin.php by clicking on the "Admin" or "Admin Home" link
  on the left side of your screen 
* (Optionally) create groups of users that share permissions
* Assign appropriate permissions 


Good luck and have fun with TikiWiki CMS/Groupware!
